            Types of Recessed Lighting We Install
          </h2>
          <p className="text-xl max-w-6xl pb-5">
            Recessed lighting comes in various styles and configurations, making
            it a versatile choice for any setting. Here's a guide to help you
            understand your options:

              <h3 className="py-5 text-2xl font-bold">Open trim</h3>
              <p className="text-xl max-w-xl pb-4">
                With this kind of trim, the light bulb is almost flush with the
                ceiling. You can't see what's on the inside of the light.
              </p>

              <p className="text-xl max-w-xl pb-4">
                Ideal for rooms with high ceilings, ceiling fan downrods allow
                the fan to hang lower, optimizing air circulation in spacious
                areas. We provide custom downrod installations to ensure the
                perfect height and balance.

              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                Inside the light fixture, this type of trim has a surface that
                reflects light. This makes the light from the recessed light
                bulb shine brighter.
              </p>

              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                An electrical box is not needed for this type of light trim.
                Instead, the light plugs right into the electrical wiring in
                your home.
              </p>

              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                Shower trim is used for recessed lighting that will be in a
                place that will get wet. Tempered glass will cover the light
                bulb in this setup to keep water out.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="py-5 text-2xl font-bold">Wall wash trim</h3>
              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                This type of trim has a shield that blocks some of the light
                from the bulb. The rest of the light is then focused in a way
                that looks like a wall wash or feature light.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="py-5 text-2xl font-bold">Gimbal trim </h3>
              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                A variation on an eyeball trim where the bulb is further back in
                the ceiling. When you move the bulb in a gimbal trim, the
                housing will block some of the light.
              </p>

              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                For larger spaces like offices, restaurants, or warehouses,
                commercial ceiling fans provide the heavy-duty performance

              </h3>
              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                The installation timeline can vary greatly depending on several
                factors, such as the size of the room, the number of fixtures to
                be installed, and the complexity of the wiring. The process
                often takes one day for a standard room, but it could extend to
                a few days for more complex projects.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                Absolutely. While older homes may present unique challenges,
                such as outdated wiring or limited access to installation areas,
                our skilled electricians have the expertise to navigate these

                Is recessed lighting energy-efficient?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                Recessed lighting can be incredibly energy-efficient, especially
                when using LED bulbs. LEDs use up to 75% less energy than
                incandescent bulbs and can last 25 times longer, adding
                significant energy and cost savings over time.

                Recessed lighting can be safely installed in bathrooms using
                fixtures rated for wet conditions. We adhere to all electrical
                and building codes to ensure a safe installation.

              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                Many of our recessed lighting fixtures come with dimmable
                options, allowing you to control the ambiance of your space
                easily. Dimming capabilities are especially useful in
                multi-purpose rooms where different lighting levels are often
                needed.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                The choice of bulb will depend on your specific needs and
                preferences. While we recommend LEDs for their energy efficiency
                and long lifespan, other options like incandescent and CFLs are
                also available. We'll provide expert advice to help you make the
                right choice.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-xl max-w-2xl pb-4">
                Maintenance is generally minimal, especially when using
                long-lasting bulbs like LEDs. However, it's important to
                periodically check fixtures and wiring for any signs of wear or
                damage. For cleaning, a simple wipe-down with a dry cloth is
                often sufficient.
